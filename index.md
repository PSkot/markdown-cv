## Profile
My name is Peter. I am 26 years old and currently employed as Data Scientist at the international consumer lending company, 4finance.
I am a highly self-driven individual with a flair and interest for Data Science and Risk Management. Previously, I have worked extensively with reporting and exploratory analytics, while I have now moved increasingly into advanced analytics, such as statistical and Machine Learning based modelling.
Apart from my professional profile, I am into playing music, programming and socializing with friends, colleagues and family.
## Work Experience

As Data Scientist I carry the primary responsibility, along with our regional Chief Risk Officer, in analyzing, managing and developing the risk/underwriting strategy

My tasks include, but are not limited to, monitoring our systems/loan portfolio, developing automated KPI reports, data manipulation/analytics/modelling related to optimization of the risk/profitability of the business
