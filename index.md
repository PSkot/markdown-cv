## Summary
My name is Peter. I am currently employed as a Data Scientist at the international consumer lending company, 4finance.
I am a highly self-driven individual with a flair and interest for advanced analytics. Until now, my approach has mostly been statistical,
although I have recently become more acquanted with Machine Learning methodologies, which I intend to explore further.<br/>
In addition, I have started to dive a bit into software programming as well, currently taking a mathematical software programming
course at the Danish Technical University (DTU).<br/>
Apart from my professional profile, I am much into playing music, running as well as spending time with friends and family.
